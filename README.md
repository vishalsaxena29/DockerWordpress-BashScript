# DockerWordpress-BashScript
Script works with the LEMP stack along with the wordpress , nginx , mysql installation with user input for sitename. 

Clone the Entire Repo in a folder and then follow the instructions.

For Running the Script and I have used the AWS t2.micro ubuntu instance 
Please open security group ports 80 , 8000 and 8080 and rest script will take care.


Please launch Script in the following order with root privlidges.

To run this script please use "sudo bash DockerChecker1.sh" and before that create a script by the same name.
--> nano DockerChecker1.sh
--> And add the code which is available in DockerChecker1.sh file.
