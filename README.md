# DockerWordpress-BashScript
Script works with the LEMP stack along with the wordpress , nginx , mysql installation with user input for sitename. 

For Running the Script and I have used the AWS t2.micro ubuntu instance 
Please open security group ports 80 , 8000 and 8080 and rest script will take care.


Please launch Script in the following order 

1. DockerChecker1.sh
2. Wordpress2.sh
